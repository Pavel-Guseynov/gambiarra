# Gambiarra

Gambiarra is an intuitive framework for CLI applications.

First of all, install it in your machine:

```shell
gem install 'gambiarra'
```
Then, on the terminal, go inside of your project, or create a new folder, `cd` into it and run:

```shell
gambiarra
```

Select `install`. You can also use it to create new `views`. That's it!


You can see it working by running:

```
  exe/your_application_name
```

Notice it will automatically get the application name by the folder name.

After that, add new views (with questions or not) and happy coding!
